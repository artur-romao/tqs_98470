## 2.2 b/ Consider that we want to test the behavior of AddressResolver#findAddressForLocation, which invokes a remote geocoding service, available in a REST interface, passing the site coordinates. Which is the SuT (subject under test)? Which is the service to mock? 

The SuT in this specific case is AddressResolver and the service to mock is ISimpleHttpClient.
